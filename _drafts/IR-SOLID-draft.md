#Interview Ready with: SOLID Principles

This is small series of blog post that aim to get a developer ready for an upcomming interview.

##Single Responsibility Principle

`"Every class should have one, and only one responsibility"`

##Open / Closed Principle

`"Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification"`

##Liskov Substituion Principle

`"Users of the base class must be able to use the derived class without knowing it"`

##Interface Segregation Principle

`"Never force a client to depend upon interfaces that they do not use"`

##Dependency Inversion Principle

`"Always depend on the abstraction and not the implementation" `
